ABOUT COWOA
------------
This module lets your customer checkout without having to register an account on your store. (Guest checkout)

COWOA also adds "order step" features to the checkout process (for both standard and guest checkout processes) which help customers CLEARLY see where they are in the checkout process.

It comes with a couple of additional (optional) modifications that let you see who used COWOA to checkout with and let's those customers who used COWOA to still be able to track the Order Status of their order by using the e-mail name they used during checkout and the OrderID number.

Originally written by KGZotU (Joe Schilz)back in February 2007 and has been modified a few times by others.
The additional mods authors are listed in their updated by text file. 

===========================
############# This is a fork version of COWOA v2.6 ######################
In this FORK, I setup three install versions.. none of which has been tested with less then php 5.4.26 and ZenCart 1.5.1 
############ DO NOT MIX AND MATCH USE ONLY IN THE CORRECT ZC VERSION ##############

ZenCart_1.5.1
ZenCart_1.5.2
ZenCart_1.5.3

All three have been tested and working on both live and test sites, at this time the sql script works on all three... 
Sorry, but this is all I'm saying for now... more help files to come, but have to create something first!
